project_title: Automating algorithm loading and executing on GPUs for SONIC
project_goal: >
  Automating the process of loading and executing machine learning algorithms on GPUs is an essential aspect of the SONIC project. SONIC, short for Services for Optimized Network Inference on Coprocessors, aims to optimize computing resource utilization for large-scale data processing involving the use of machine learning algorithms to identify and categorize reconstructed particles from collisions.
