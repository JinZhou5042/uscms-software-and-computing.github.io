project_title: Development of a Distributed GPU ML Training Facility at Vanderbilt's ACCRE Cluster
project_goal: >
    The objective of this project is to leverage the knowledge and hardware available within the Vanderbilt research computing center (ACCRE) to develop a prototype distributed GPU ML training facility. We aim to provide the efficiency boost of training on a multi-GPU platform to CMS users and beyond, while abstracting away the highly technical details necessary to do so.

  We have compiled ML training examples to familiarize new users with our recommended running environments and packages. These include functionality to log training runs on MLflow, a platform that facilitates important aspects of the training cycle, such as metric monitoring, reproducibility, and deployment. We have put together a "quick start" guide, which are working on expanding to be full-fledged user documentation. We have single-GPU training capabilities in place and are currently working on interfacing with multiple GPUs and submission to multi-GPU nodes via our schedulers.
