project_title: AI Denoising to Accelerate Detector Simulation
project_goal: >
    Develop fast and accurate simulation of highly granular calorimeters using
    machine learning models.
    Use a 'denoising' approach to upscale existing physics-based fast
    simulation to achieve better quality at similar speeds.

current_status: >
  In progress. Have successfully developed denoising diffusion model for calorimeter
  simulation that achieves state of the art results on public datasets.
  Next steps are to explore diffusing from fast simulation rather than pure noise 
  and to apply the model to simulate the current CMS calorimeter and eventually the HGCal design.
