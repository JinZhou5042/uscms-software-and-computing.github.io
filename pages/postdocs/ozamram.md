project_title: AI Denoising to Accelerate Detector Simulation
project_goal: >
    Develop fast and accurate simulation of highly granular calorimeters using
    machine learning models.
    Use a 'denoising' approach to upscale existing physics-based fast
    simulation to achieve better quality at similar speeds.
