project_title: Developing heterogeneous particle flow reconstruction for the CMS Phase 2 detector
project_goal: >
    The goal of the project is to develop particle flow reconstruction for the CMS Phase 2, using 'The Iterative CLustering' (TICL) as a baseline, to improve physics performance, and to establish a coherent PF reconstruction across all calorimeters. TICL is a modular framework developed for heterogeneous infrastructure that provides particle shower reconstruction and particle flow candidate reconstruction. It was primarily developed for HGCAL but could also work well for other calorimeter regions, thus enabling coherent reconstruction across all calorimeter regions. Additionally, we will work on further completing the transition of the CUDA-based software-implemented PF modules to a portability library, 'Alpaka,' and deploy it not only for use at the high-level trigger (HLT) but also for offline reconstruction.
