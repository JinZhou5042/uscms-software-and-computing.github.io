project_title: Deploying GPU algorithms through SONIC
project_goal: >
    The goal of the project is to demonstrate at a sufficiently large scale the reconstruction algorithm workflow within CMSSW to be processed, where the client jobs are running on one site, while the Line Segment Tracking (LST) algorithm will be executed on GPUs on computing nodes at another site connected through SONIC (Services for Optimized Network Inference on Co-processors) framework.
