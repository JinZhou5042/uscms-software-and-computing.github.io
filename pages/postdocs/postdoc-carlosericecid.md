project_goal: >
  The proposed project consists of two thrusts: (1) adapting pixel unpacking to execute on GPUs and (2) adapting the vertex reconstruction algorithm to execute on GPUs and, more in general, to generic heterogeneous architectures through the Alpaka libraries. These projects are synergistic and leverage existing expertise at Boston University in back-end readout electronics to expand the group's research program into the area of heterogeneous computing for the HL-LHC era. The pixel unpacking project will serve as an educational bridge project, and the vertex reconstruction effort will take advantage of the gained expertise to accelerate a resource-intensive portion of the HL-LHC reconstruction.
